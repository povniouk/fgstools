# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Context

Greenfield LNG facility EPC project. The owner of this repo is a **control systems engineer** responsible for the **Fire & Gas (F&G) scope**, working as part of the EPC contractor team. The client (Owner) submits deliverables for review; HSED is the internal department that owns Fire & Safety design and provides the governing specifications.

The goal of this project is to build AI-assisted tools that automate verification, cross-checking, and consistency work that is currently done manually across large documents and datasets.

**GitHub repo:** `https://github.com/povniouk/fgstools` (private)
**SSH key for GitHub:** `~/.ssh/github_fgstools` (ed25519, on dev VM 192.168.8.229)

## Domain Knowledge

### Standards
- IEC 61511 — Functional safety for process industry
- IEC 60079 — Hazardous area classification
- Project specs always take precedence; every check must be traceable to a spec clause

### Key Interfaces
- **HSED** → provides governing specs and FGS layouts; defines interfaces with PA/GA, HVAC, FACP
  - HSED is split across **HOC** (Houston Operating Center) and **BoOC** (Bogota Operational Center)
- **PA/GA** — Public Address / General Alarm system
- **HVAC** — interfaces triggered by F&G detection events
- **FACP** — Fire Alarm Control Panel (building level), sends confirmed fire signal to FGS controller
- **FGS controller** — master Fire & Gas System controller; receives FACP signals, triggers PA/GA, etc.

### Typical Logic Chain (example)
Confirmed fire in building → FACP sends signal to FGS controller → FGS enables PA/GA activation
Every link in this chain must be traceable to a spec clause.

### SPI Data Limitation (important context)
SPI exports are currently incomplete — data from HSED HOC and HSED BoOC is not yet fully reflected. Do not treat the SPI as a complete source of truth until this is resolved. The email tracker tool is being prioritised first for this reason.

---

## Input Documents

### Spec PDFs (from HSED — source of truth for all verification)
- Fire & Safety Philosophy
- Fire & Safety Specification Buildings
- Fire and Gas System (FGS) Specification
- Format: PDF, typically <100 pages each
- Revised during project execution; revisions tracked via color track changes in the document
- Stored in `FGS_SPEC/` folder in this repo; copied to `~/spec-qa/specs/` on the `fgstools` LXC for serving

### FGS Layouts
- Plot plans showing physical location of F&G detectors
- Provided by HSED

### Cause & Effect (C&E) Matrix
- Working format: **Excel** (exported to PDF for Owner submission)
- Structure: causes (inputs) on rows, actions (outputs) on columns, intersection marked with X or 1
- Actions grouped by system (FGS, PA/GA, HVAC, FACP, etc.)
- Not yet released at project start — to be developed and verified against specs

### P&IDs
- Firewater system P&IDs provided by HSED

### SPI (SmartPlant Instrumentation) Export
- Source: SPI database managed by the SPI team
- Delivery: weekly Excel export sent by email
- Scale: ~2500+ F&G I/O tags in scope
- Key columns: Tag Number, Loop Number, Software Typical, Service Description, Fire Zone, FGS Layout, Detector Type, System1 (FGS), IO Type 1 (Input/Output)

## Target Architecture — Integrated Dashboard

All tools will live under a **single Flask app** (port 5000 on `fgstools` LXC) with a tabbed dashboard as the home page. Each tool is a Python module. One shared SQLite database (`cwlng.db`) for all structured data.

**Dashboard tabs (planned):**

| Tab | Status | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
| Overview | Planned | KPIs: open actions, pending reviews, last SPI import date |
| Spec Q&A | Complete (Tool 1) | Current standalone app, to be integrated |
| Email Tracker | Next to build | Deliverable tracking from forwarded emails |
| SPI Checker | Planned (Tool 2) | Waiting for complete SPI data |
| C&E Checker | Planned (Tool 3) | Waiting for first C&E draft |

**Operational requirements (non-negotiable):**
- App must run as a **systemd service** — starts on boot, restarts on crash, no terminal needed for day-to-day operation
- Admin tab in the dashboard for: restart, view logs, trigger update
- User never needs SSH or terminal for normal use — browser only

---

## Tools to Build

### Tool 1 — Spec Q&A (`spec-qa`) — COMPLETE v2
**Purpose:** Query spec PDFs in plain language and get answers with exact clause references.

**Example:** *"What is the required voting logic for confirmed gas detection in a compressor building?"*
→ Returns answer + spec name, revision, section reference.

**Location:** `tool1_spec_qa/` in this repo; deployed to `~/spec-qa/` on `fgstools` LXC
**Access:** `http://192.168.8.117:5000`
**Stack:** Flask + pdfplumber + scikit-learn TF-IDF + Ollama API (`http://192.168.8.200:11434`)

**Features implemented (v3):**
- Integrated dashboard with tabs: Overview, Spec Q&A, Email Tracker, SPI Checker (placeholder), C&E Checker (placeholder), Admin
- Systemd service (`fgstools.service`) — auto-start on boot, restart on crash
- Admin tab: Chunk Inspector, Infrastructure info, Re-index email memory button
- **Retrieval stack:** BM25 + TF-IDF + `nomic-embed-text` embeddings via Ollama, merged via Reciprocal Rank Fusion. Cross-encoder re-ranker (`bge-reranker-base`) as second pass — retrieves 3×top_k candidates then re-scores to top_k.
- **PDF parsing:** pdfplumber `find_tables()` + inline extraction; tables rendered as bullet points (`• cell — cell`). Boilerplate stripped per page.
- **Table-aware chunking:** tables are atomic chunks with preceding prose as context prefix; prose word-chunked with overlap between tables
- **Clickable source tags** — spec sources open the PDF at the cited page (`/pdf/<filename>#page=N`); email sources open a modal showing the full email
- **Email history toggle** — off by default; when on, approved email bodies are searched alongside specs and cited as `[Email — Sender, Date]`
- Two-page UI: Q&A (default) and Manage Specs (upload, edit metadata, delete)
- Model selector in header; embedding models filtered out of the list
- Thinking toggle (off by default); Email history toggle
- Real-time log panel (SSE stream), Markdown rendering (marked.js bundled locally)
- VS Code dark theme; Enter to send query, Shift+Enter for newline
- **Streaming responses** — SSE; sources sent after stream completes, matched to what the model actually cited
- **Generation tuning** — temperature `0.2`, `repeat_penalty 1.5`, `repeat_last_n 512`, `top_p 0.9`, `num_predict` 1024
- **Memory-cached specs** — chunks + metadata cached keyed by file mtime
- **Loop guard** — repetition detector aborts stream; `MAX_THINK_CHARS=6000` thinking cap

**Tunables (env vars):** `OLLAMA_URL`, `OLLAMA_MODEL`, `SPECS_DIR`, `TOP_K` (default 6), `TEMPERATURE`, `NUM_PREDICT`, `MAX_THINK_CHARS`

**Known issues:**
- `gemma4:26b` with thinking enabled occasionally degenerates into repetition loops. Root cause: 22% CPU spill (26B doesn't fit in 16GB VRAM). Next to try: `gemma4:26b-nvfp4` (Blackwell FP4, fits in VRAM).
- `gemma4:latest` (12B) stable for production use.

**RAG pipeline — status:**

| Challenge | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| PDF table extraction | ✅ Done | pdfplumber + bullet-point format |
| Table atomicity | ✅ Done | Atomic chunks with prose context prefix |
| Semantic embeddings | ✅ Done | `nomic-embed-text` via Ollama, cached to `.npy` |
| Cross-encoder re-ranker | ✅ Done | `bge-reranker-base` via `sentence-transformers` on fgstools LXC (CPU); installed and live |
| Email memory (RAG) | ✅ Done | Approved emails chunked + embedded in `cwlng.db`; searchable via Email history toggle |
| Word-count chunking | ⚠️ Partial | Prose chunks word-count based; semantic chunking deferred |
| Vocabulary mismatch | ⚠️ Partial | Synonym dict + embeddings. Works for known terms. |

**Re-ranker install status:** ✅ Complete
- `bge-reranker-base` installed and live on fgstools LXC (`sentence-transformers` 5.4.1, `torch` 2.11.0+cpu)
- Lazy-loads on first query; model cached locally after first load (~270MB)
- Retriever fetches 3×top_k candidates, re-ranks to top_k

---

### Tool 5 — Email Tracker — COMPLETE (M1–M7)
**Purpose:** Track deliverables, action items, and blocking points from project emails. Secondary purpose: build a searchable project memory from email history to complement the spec Q&A tool.

**Ingestion method (decided):** User drags email from Outlook to Desktop → saves as `.eml` → drags `.eml` to the browser drop zone. Also accepts `.msg`. No Gmail/IMAP needed — no external accounts, fully local.

**Stack:** `email_tracker.py` Flask Blueprint, SQLite (`cwlng.db`), Ollama extraction via streaming API.

**Disciplines:** HSED, ICSS, Electrical, HVAC, Telecom, Instrumentation, Other

**Scope tags (replaces document_ref):** SPI, C&E, FGS Layouts, Document Review, Interface, General, Other

**Categories:** Comment response, IFR submittal, Technical query, Information request, Meeting action *(blocking point is a separate checkbox, not a category)*

**Status values:** Open / In Progress / Closed

---

#### Tool 5 — Milestone Plan

**M1 — Basic import + action register** ✅ DONE
- `.eml` / `.msg` parsing (Python `email` lib + `extract-msg`)
- Ollama extraction via streaming with `think=False`
- Draft cards: approve / discard per item or all at once
- SQLite tables: `emails`, `action_items`
- Action register: filterable by status/discipline, inline status change, delete

**M2 — Card + register field cleanup** ✅ DONE
- Simplified draft card to 5 fields: Action, Discipline, Scope, Priority, Deadline (blocking point as header checkbox only)
- New discipline list: HSED, ICSS, Electrical, HVAC, Telecom, Instrumentation, Other
- Replaced document_ref with Scope dropdown: SPI, C&E, FGS Layouts, Document Review, Interface, General, Other
- Removed "Blocking point" from category list
- Updated Ollama extraction prompt to match new fields

**M3 — Register table layout fix** ✅ DONE
- Slimmed to 7 columns: Priority | Discipline | Action | Scope | Deadline | Status | ×
- Added overflow-x:auto wrapper to prevent button overflow

**M3.5 — Contacts directory** ✅ DONE
- New sub-tab in Email Tracker: Import | Action Register | **Contacts**
- New DB table: `contacts (id, name, email, position, operating_center, discipline, notes, source, created_at, updated_at)`
- **Operating centers:** POC (Paris), HOC (Houston), BoOC (Bogota), Owner, Vendor, Other
- **Auto-extraction on email import:** Ollama extracts sender contact details (name, email, position, operating center) from the email signature in the same extraction call. Matched by email address — updates existing record rather than duplicating.
- **Manual add/edit:** Form to add or edit contacts not coming from email
- **Contact table view:** Name | Position | Operating Center | Discipline | Email
- Click row → inline edit or simple modal
- Future link to M4 side panel: "open actions from this person" count shown in contact row

**M4 — Side detail / edit panel** ✅ DONE
- Click a register row → right-side panel slides in
- Panel shows all fields, fully editable
- Save button writes changes back to DB
- Close/dismiss returns to register
- Delete button in panel footer

**M5 — Append-only notes log** ✅ DONE
- Notes section inside detail panel
- Each entry is timestamped and appended — history never overwritten
- Supports plain text; renders as a log (newest at top)
- New DB column: `notes` (JSON array of `{ts, text}`) or separate `item_notes` table

**M6 — File attachments per action item** ✅ DONE
- Drag & drop or file picker in the detail panel: PNG/JPG screenshots, PDF, `.eml`, Word docs
- Files stored on LXC filesystem: `~/spec-qa/attachments/<item_id>/`
- New DB table: `attachments (id, item_id, filename, original_name, uploaded_at)`
- Listed in panel with filename + upload date; click to download
- Close action button: sets status to Closed, records timestamp in notes log

**M7 — Email as project memory (RAG integration)** ✅ DONE
- Cleaned email bodies chunked and embedded alongside spec chunks in the retrieval pool
- Each email chunk tagged with sender, date, discipline (cites as `[Email — Sender, Date]`)
- Q&A tool searches specs + email history simultaneously
- Decisions, interface clarifications, and responsibility assignments become findable by natural language query
- Trigger: any approved email is automatically indexed; re-index on demand from Admin tab

### Tool 2 — SPI Consistency Checker — IN PROGRESS

**Purpose:** Ingest weekly SPI Excel export, run rule-based checks derived from specs, output anomaly report. Store each weekly import in SQLite with timestamp; diff against prior week to surface new issues, resolved issues, and changed fields.

**SPI data reality (W18 analysis):**
- 7,683 total rows in export — 198 are F&G (141 FGS + 57 LFGS)
- Expected ~2500 F&G tags — gap is HOC data missing entirely (only BoOC + COC present)
- Tag_Type blank for all F&G tags — data quality issue
- Key columns: Tag_Number, System1, IO_Type1, Typical, Tag_Serv, Area_Class, Unit_name, Design_By, Status
- No Fire Zone or FGS Layout column in current export — deferred to M5

**Input:** Weekly SPI Excel export (.xlsx), drag-drop in browser
**Stack:** `spi_checker.py` Flask Blueprint, SQLite (`spi_imports`, `spi_tags` tables), openpyxl

---

#### Tool 2 — Milestone Plan

**M1 — Import + storage** ✅ IN PROGRESS
- Drag-drop .xlsx upload on SPI Checker tab (no VS Code needed)
- Parse Excel, filter F&G tags (System1 = FGS/LFGS)
- SQLite tables: `spi_imports`, `spi_tags`
- Import summary: week label, total rows, F&G count, timestamp
- Import history list (all past imports)

**M2 — F&G loop register** ← NEXT TO BUILD (after email tracker folder refactor — see below)
- Primary view: **grouped by Loop_Name** — loop row is collapsed by default, click to expand tag sub-rows one at a time
- Secondary view: flat tag list (toggle)
- Sorted alphabetically by Loop_Name; no special ordering for missing Typical
- Filters: System1/System2, IO_Type1, Design_By; **Warnings filter** to show only loops with issues
- Warnings column on each loop row (filterable): missing Typical, inconsistent Typical within loop (tags have different Typical values), missing Area Class on any tag in loop
- Key columns per loop row: Loop_Name | Typical | Tag Count | Warnings
- Key columns per tag sub-row: Tag Number | System1 | System2 | IO Type | Service | Area Class | Design By | Status | Flags
- Loop_Name format confirmed correct (e.g. `A -001001`)

**M3 — Automated flag checks**
- Missing Typical
- Missing Area_Class
- Blank Tag_Type
- Status = TBF on key fields
- Duplicate tag numbers
- Flag badges per row + summary count at top
- Flags tab showing only flagged tags

**M4 — Week-over-week diff**
- On import, compare against previous week
- New tags, removed tags, changed fields (Typical, Status, Area_Class, etc.)
- Delta report shown after import, accessible from history
- Highlight what changed since last week

**M5 — Spec rule checks (deferred until data complete)**
- Detector type vs fire zone vs spec requirement (needs HOC data + Fire Zone field)
- All FGS input tags have Typical populated
- Traceable to spec clause

---

### Tool 3 — C&E vs Spec Checker — PLANNED
**Purpose:** Read C&E Excel matrix and verify cause-action pairs are consistent with spec requirements.

**Example checks:**
- Confirmed fire in building X → FACP signal to FGS → PA/GA activation: is the X present in the matrix?
- No actions present in C&E that are not supported by spec

**Input:** C&E Excel (available once first draft is released)

---

### Tool 4 — Revision Delta Tracker — PLANNED
**Purpose:** Compare two revisions of a spec PDF, output list of changed clauses, flag which Tool 2 rules or Tool 3 checks are potentially invalidated. Triggered automatically when a new spec is uploaded.

**Input:** Two PDF revisions of the same spec document

---

### Additional tools considered (brainstorm, not yet scoped)
- **Document submittal register (Tool 8 candidate)** — replaces manual GAIA monitoring; import GAIA Excel export, diff against previous import, surface new revisions and status changes (the notification GAIA doesn't send); each document has TEN ref + client ref, revisions A/B/C→00/01/02, statuses IFI/IFR/IFC/IFA/IFD etc.; new spec revision detected → trigger Tool 4 (revision delta); ingestion: periodic Excel export (SSO-only, no API)
- **Meeting minutes action extractor** — paste or forward meeting minutes, AI extracts action items with owners and deadlines
- **Overview / KPI dashboard** — open actions count, pending reviews, last SPI import, spec revision alerts
- **Detector type cards (Tool 6 candidate)** — one card per F&G detector type (IR point gas, catalytic bead, open path, UV/IR flame, heat, smoke, MCP, etc.); each card shows governing spec clause(s), typical application, voting logic, test/maintenance interval; auto-populated via RAG on first build then cached; SPI tag counts + fire zones added as second phase once SPI data is complete
- **System interface map (Tool 7 candidate)** — interactive node-graph of FGS interfaces: FGS↔SIS, FGS↔BPCS, FGS↔PA/GA, FGS↔HVAC, FGS↔FACP, FACP↔buildings; each edge carries signal direction, governing spec clause, and status (defined/pending/open query); click-through to spec clause + related emails; starts as manually-built editable diagram, bundled JS graph lib (no CDN)
- **Deadline digest** — "this week / overdue" widget on the Overview tab surfacing action items by due date; built on existing action_items table; requires no new data, just a view
- **Comment response tracker** — per document revision, log client review comments with status (open / responded / accepted / rejected); ties into GAIA register (new IFR submission opens a comment log); tracks formal audit trail for document review cycle
- **Technical Query (TQ) register** — dedicated register for TQs between contractor and client; fields: TQ number, subject, originator, linked spec clause, status, linked email; email tracker already captures TQs as a category — this promotes them to a first-class register
- **Spec clause reverse lookup** ✅ DONE — keyword/tag search (`GET /api/search?q=`) returning all chunks that contain the term; sub-tab "Clause Search" in Spec Q&A; results with highlighted terms, TABLE badge, clickable PDF page links; no LLM, near-instant
- **Weekly summary generator** — auto-generated one-page digest: open actions, overdue items, new document releases, new emails from past 7 days; all data already in SQLite, mostly a reporting query; useful for personal review and team status updates

## Infrastructure

### Developer Machine
- VM at `192.168.8.229` — dev environment, VS Code, Claude Code
- Company laptop has no admin rights — accesses all tools via browser only
- Git repo at `/home/povniouk/my-projects/CWLNG/`

### Proxmox Server
- Hardware: AMD Ryzen 9 5950X, 64GB RAM, RTX 5060 Ti 16GB VRAM
- IOMMU enabled

### AI VM — `gemma4` (VM 102) — `192.168.8.200`
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04 Server (headless, SSH only)
- GPU: RTX 5060 Ti passed through via VFIO (IDs: `10de:2d04`, `10de:22eb`)
- QEMU args: `-cpu host,kvm=off`
- AI runtime: **Ollama**, default model **`gemma4:latest`** (12B, fits 100% in VRAM); `gemma4:26b` available but spills to CPU (22% CPU / 78% GPU)
- Ollama listens on `0.0.0.0:11434`, env: `OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE=24h` (model stays warm in VRAM)
- **Reranker service (pending install):** `BAAI/bge-reranker-base` via sentence-transformers, port `11435`. Service file at `reranker/reranker.service` in repo. Install: create `~/reranker/`, venv, `pip install flask sentence-transformers`, copy `reranker/app.py`, enable systemd service.
- Models pulled: `gemma4:latest`, `gemma4:26b`, `nomic-embed-text:latest`

**Quantization notes:**
- For Blackwell GPUs (RTX 50 series), `*-nvfp4` variants leverage native FP4 tensor cores — smaller, faster, higher quality than INT4 quants. Worth trying for any model that doesn't fit at default quant.
- NVFP4 builds typically drop the vision adapter — text-only. Fine for spec Q&A (PDFs go through pdfplumber text extraction, no OCR).

### App LXC — `fgstools` — `192.168.8.117`
- OS: Debian 13 (headless, SSH only)
- Hosts all web application tools
- Calls Ollama on `gemma4` at `http://192.168.8.200:11434`
- App folder: `~/spec-qa/`
- Spec PDFs stored in `~/spec-qa/specs/`
- SQLite database: `~/spec-qa/cwlng.db` (emails, action_items, contacts, attachments, email_chunks)
- File attachments stored in `~/spec-qa/attachments/<item_id>/`
- RAM: 2048MB (bumped from 1024MB to support sentence-transformers install)
- **App must run as systemd service** — not manually from terminal

### Why local AI instead of cloud API
Spec PDFs and project data are confidential EPC deliverables. Sending them to any external API is a security and contractual risk. All AI inference runs locally on the Proxmox server.

### GPU not used by Ollama — recovery
Symptom: `ollama ps` shows `100% CPU`, queries are very slow (>2 min), `nvtop`/`nvidia-smi` show no GPU activity.
Cause seen on this setup: Ollama loaded a model into CPU before its CUDA detection initialised properly (Blackwell GB206 + CUDA 13).
Fix: `sudo systemctl restart ollama`, then send a fresh query. Verify with `ollama ps` — should show `100% GPU`. Inspect startup logs with `journalctl -u ollama --since "1 minute ago"` — look for `inference compute ... library=CUDA ... description="NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Ti"`. If absent, the GPU isn't being discovered.
